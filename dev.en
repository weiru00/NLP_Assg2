you may assume an ideal case. ) 
like any other financial services company , abc must provide regular reports that measure its performance to its clients .
use the abbreviations given in brackets and make each formula begin with a quantifier , not with a negation symbol :
abc measures its performance with what they call as their care report .
t ( x ) : x has many shopping centers
the recovery percentages that appear in the care report are the primary measure of performance for abc clients .
supply chain management is less about managing the physical movement of goods and more about managing information .
abc first deployed their care report via a c program .
fill in the blank cells with appropriate answers .
but , the care report for all clients was taking over hours to process and the resulting report was inflexible .
they need to narrow down the list of potential projects to those projects that will be of most benefit .
there was no way to quickly focus in on a single client or client contract and there was no way to change the level of detail .
propose a design for the parallel algorithm by highlighting on the shared and local variables required and the algorithmic steps which may require synchronisation .
there was also no way to further analyze the results , e. g. by loan type , so they could discern what portions of their business are most lucrative .
even the company 's catch phrase , ' connecting people ' , is symbolic of the culture , and helps define the purpose of its physical facilities. the
